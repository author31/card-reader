# card-reader
Simple card check-in program
This project is using Python to ultize the feature of Mifare card reader which reads the card number and then enter
Reading those data is for building a database with card id and the card owner's name
Because this is a small scale version, I just use Google sheet to store those information
After building a database, it's time for card owner check-in whenver they get in their office.
Once they tap the card on the card reader, it'll record the name and the time they tapped. Those information is also store on
Google sheet
